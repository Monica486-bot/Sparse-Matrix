Sparse-Matrix

This project implements a custom Sparse Matrix data structure in Python to efficiently handle large matrices with mostly zero values, It allows users to load two sparse matrices from input files, perform addition, subtraction, or multiplication operations, and outputs the results, all without using built-in libraries such as NumPy or regex.  
The program reads matrices from files in a specific format, handles input errors gracefully, and provides an interactive menu for operation selection.  
It is optimized for both memory usage and runtime.
